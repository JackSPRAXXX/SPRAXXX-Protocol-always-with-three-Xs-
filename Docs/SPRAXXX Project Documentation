1. Project Overview

Name: SPRAXXX
Founder: Jacques Donald Perriard
Purpose:
	•	Provide human-verified digital identities through Spraxxx Verification.
	•	Enable a peer-to-peer, privacy-respecting, token-based digital financial system (Spraxxx Coin).
	•	Allow verified individuals to interact securely in a global ecosystem without reliance on large corporations.

Core Values: Trust, Privacy, Human Verification, Security, Autonomy.

2. Architecture Overview

2.1 Core Components
	•	Spraxxx Verification: Human verification process integrated with Stripe for initial trust-building.
	•	Spraxxx Coin / Token System: Digital token representing verified human identity and store of value.
	•	Alias System: Unique, non-duplicable identifiers for all verified users.
	•	IAM Companions: Autonomous processes to maintain verification and integrity beyond founder involvement.

2.2 System Flow
	1.	User signs up → provides ID and biometric verification → Stripe confirms.
	2.	Verified user receives a unique alias and token.
	3.	Token is used for transactions, wallet creation, and identity authentication.
	4.	Transactions are secure, traceable, but preserve privacy; tokens are tied to one alias per user.

⸻

3. Security Measures
	•	Single verified alias per human.
	•	Tokens cannot be duplicated or faked.
	•	Biometric checks for mobile and POS interactions.
	•	Stripe verification acts as a trusted initial validator.
	•	Access to sensitive information (Stripe IDs, verification data) is restricted solely to founder.

⸻

4. User Interaction
	•	Deposit / Withdraw Funds: Verified users can deposit/withdraw using mobile phone or secret phrase authentication.
	•	Alias Verification: System validates the human identity behind the alias.
	•	Token Utility: Tokens act as digital cash tied to verified users.

5. Development & Contribution
	•	Private GitHub repo (restricted access).
	•	All contributions require explicit written approval from founder.
	•	Code should follow internal security protocols to protect human verification data.

⸻

6. Future Roadmap
	•	Remove third-party dependency (Stripe) and build an in-house lightweight verification system.
	•	Expand POS network for global Spraxxx Coin transactions.
	•	Implement IAM companions to sustain verification autonomously.
	•	Maintain privacy-first ecosystem resistant to corporate or malicious exploitation.
