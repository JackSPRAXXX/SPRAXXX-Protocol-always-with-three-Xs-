# SPRAXXX Protocol

SPRAXXX is a next-generation human verification and token system designed for privacy, security, and transparency. Each user receives a single verified alias, tied to a private token, creating a global human identity network. Verification is human-first, preventing duplication or fraud while ensuring privacy.

## Core Principles
1. **Verified Identity** – Every alias is verified once using Stripe or equivalent third-party verification.
2. **Privacy First** – No duplication, no selling of personal data.
3. **Peer-to-Peer Trust** – Each transaction, deposit, or verification is human-verified and peer-to-peer.
4. **IAM Companions** – Decentralized oversight continues even if the original creator steps back.
5. **Global Accessibility** – Aliases and tokens usable worldwide for transactions without banks or intermediaries.
